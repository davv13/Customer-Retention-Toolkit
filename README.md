# DS223_Project
In the dynamic landscape of subscription-based services, maintaining a solid customer base is fundamental for ensuring business longevity and success. One of the critical metrics that businesses closely monitor is customer churn, which refers to the rate at which customers discontinue their subscription or usage of a service. High churn rates can have a detrimental effect on revenue streams, profitability, and overall growth trajectory. Therefore, it is imperative for subscription-based businesses to proactively identify customers who are likely to churn and implement targeted retention strategies to retain them.

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast which customers are on the verge of churning based on their historical behavior, interactions, and engagement patterns with the service. By employing advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, the project aims to analyze the vast amount of available customer data to discern meaningful patterns and features that contribute to churn. These insights will be leveraged to construct a predictive model capable of identifying potential churners.
